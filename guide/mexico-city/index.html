                <h2>Preamble</h2>

                <p>Mexico's Capital City, often referred to as just <span lang="es">CDMX</span> (Mexico City, <span lang="es">Ciudad de Mexico</span>, <span lang="es">CDMX</span>) or <span lang="es">"El D.F."</span> (the Federal District, <span lang="es">el Distrito Federal</span>, <span lang="es">D.F.</span>), is the most populous city in North America. In recent years, Mexico City has emerged as a top destination for expats, celebrated for its vibrancy, history and culture, while the city is giving way to its former reputation of crime and pollution.</p>

                <p>Mexico City <em>sprawls</em> - as you fly in, you cannot help but to be amazed by its sheer size. If you fly in at night, the lights you'll see glowing go on as far the eye can see: if you fly in by day, the never ending mosaic of buildings, roads and landmarks will extend far into the distance. Fortunately, a lot of the really attractive centres in Mexico are clustered together in easy-to-get-to areas. Three or four days here should be enough for you to experience all of the main attractions. For those willing to explore with an open mind, Mexico City has a feast of experiences waiting for you to enjoy and savour.</p>

                <p>To dismiss Mexico City for its size or previous reputation would be denying your self a lifetime opportunity to sense, feel and experience one of the world's most contrasting; but also greatest, oldest and most inspiring cities.</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><p>For those with a refined palate, the choice of restaurants here is immense: whatever food you like or want to experience - you can in Mexico City.</p></li>

                    <li><p>For the shoppers, Mexico City provides ultra-high doses of retail therapy, with a colossal variety of colours and flavours: Fruit and vegetable stalls, local one day a week markets, colonial markets and bazaars, specialist art and craft centres, chic boutiques, designer clothes and jewellery - it's all here, all you have to do is start looking.</p></li>

                    <li><p>For history, culture and archaeology fans, you will find a plethora of areas and places to feed their thirst for new insight and knowledge. World-class museums, arts and theatre, sculpture, murals and plazas, and a history which extends back over 12,000 years, to the first animals and inhabitants around Lake Texcoco - the lake Mexico City was built on - and on which bed it still lies.</p></li>

                    <li><p>For those that like to chill, Mexico City also has several parks and natural areas, where people go to relax, converse, meet and just watch the world go by.</p></li>

                    <li><p>For general entertainment, Mexico City will fulfil just about any activity you have in mind that can logistically be catered for in an urban area. The night life is stunning and varied; during the day you can play sports, go to a funfair, ice-skate and a thousand other activities are all within a distance no further away than a couple of hours from your hotel's entrance.</p></li>
                </ul>

                <p>Not everyone fly in to Mexico City's airport visit Mexico City. Some are there only to connect to an ongoing flight elsewhere, usually a colonial centre or coastal destination. However, Mexico City <em>by itself</em> a great place to experience - there is a certain magic there that leaves a dust on its visitors' shoes which in most cases keeps them coming back for even more next time.</p>

                <h2>I.</h2>
                <p>The attractions listed here are but a sample of the vast experiences waiting for you to savour in Mexico City. I recommend that, once your appetite is whetted from here, <em>get a Mexican friend and ask what's more!</em>.</p>

                <h3>Mexico City's Colonial Centre</h3>
                <p>The <span lang="es">Centro Histórico</span> (Historic Centre) focuses around the <span lang="es">Plaza de la Constitución</span> (Constitution Plaza) or more commonly known as the <span lang="es">Zocalo</span> (the Plaza), the second biggest in the world - only Moscow's Red Square betters it for size. This is the heart of Mexico City and its government, main business and financial centres all operate in and around this area. There are over 1,400 colonial buildings in this area: the feel is distinctly Spanish - they built their new city on top of the destroyed Aztec City of <span lang="nah">Tenōchtitlan</span>. Off the Plaza you can find the city's Cathedral and <span lang="es">Palacio National</span> (National Palace) - both are stunning examples of glorious colonial architecture. You can see some of the remains of the old city by visiting <span lang="es">Templo Mayor</span> - the archaeological site in the heart of Mexico City.</p>

                <h3><span lang="es">Zona Rosa</span></h3>
                <p>Translated, this literally means, "the pink zone", referring to the pink coloured tiles on the street, still there today. It was once the high-class residential area of Mexico City, before tourism, shops, restaurants, hotels and commercial office space took it over. Today, it is the centre of all commercial activity in Mexico, with up-market shops, hotels, restaurants and office space. There are some great hotels and restaurants to experience here, if you're not on an overly-tight budget. This area, along with San Angel (see below) is one of Mexico City's main night spots.</p>


                <h3>Coyoacán & San Ángel</h3>
                <p>These two colonial areas make up districts of today's Mexico City, but it hasn't always been this way. Not so many years ago, these areas were separate colonial towns in their own right! They both have a colonial atmosphere and charm all their own and are well worth a visit - especially at the weekend!</p>

                <p><i>Coyoacán</i>: The Central Plaza is a classic - with its street performers and ambulant vendors; a real family place on a Saturday afternoon. The streets in this area are all cobbled; the area is home to some of Mexico City's finest mansions and great museums. Many present-day celebrities live around here, as past celebrities have, including: Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera and Leon Trotsky.</p>

                <p><i>San Ángel</i>: Once a quaint town on the outskirts: now a suburb for the rich and famous, with cobblestone streets and leafy lanes. Some of the houses here are more modern, but there is also a great selection of colonial houses, mansions and haciendas. Some of these places have been turned into fine restaurants and fashionable night clubs. San Ángel is also one of Mexico City's prime night spots (see below).</p>

                <h3><span lang="nah">Chapultepec</span></h3>
                <p>Mexico City's large green area, <span lang="es">Bosque de Chapultepec</span> or just <span lang="nah">Chapultepec</span> (From the Aztec, meaning "Place of the Grasshopper") is the largest area west of the city, and incorporates: Chapultepec Park itself, the Castle where Maximilian ruled from before he met his fate in Queretaro, Mexico City's extensive Zoo, The world-famous Anthropology Museum, Chapultepec Fun Fair with its famous "Russian Mountain" wooden roller-coaster, several top-class Museums and Cultural Centres, and some of the City's finest Hotels and Restaurants. Just north of Chapultepec is the district of Polanco, an ultra-high class residential area, which is also host to Mexico's biggest and most elaborate US-Style Shopping Mall, Santa Fe.</p>

                <h3>Floating gardens of <span lang="nah">Xochimilco</span></h3>
                <p><span lang="nah">Xochimilco</span> was considered outside of Mexico City as late as the 1970's. Today, it has been engulfed into the massive sprawl of the Capital, but the floating gardens - so called because of the the brightly decorated boats that float on a network of canals which is 50 miles long - and dates back to the time of the Aztecs.</p>

                <p>In years gone by, the boats would be decorated with real flowers, thus "floating gardens", but today only paint is used, save for special occasions, often requiring pre-booking and payment by the sponsor.</p>

                <p><span lang="nah">Xochimilco</span> itself is an old colonial town. Although run-down and in a seemingly state of decay, the area has a great colonial centre, and a couple of good markets. You'll pass these on route to the canal ports (of which there are several) - so take time to stop and experience them.</p>

                <p>For a very small fee, you can hire a boat to take you and up to 40 other people on a tour of the canal and environs. Boats come in three sizes; the small will seat up to around 10 people, the medium up to about 25 and the large up to about 40. Prices vary according to the size of boat (in Spanish <span lang="es">lancha</span>) you want, but prices are very reasonable.</p>

                <p>A bucket with beers and soft drinks will be placed on the boat; you pay for what you consume, plus a small tip for the vendor when you get back to port.</p>

                <p>While you're on your canal tour, you'll likely be approached by ambulant "floating merchants" selling anything from pottery and textiles to a full 5-course meal! Beware of the food, stick to the purified drinks bucket. Mexican mariachis may float up beside you on their boat, and in exchange for a small fee, will serenade your cruise or party with a feast of traditional Mexican music. Don't miss this opportunity!.. Remember to take some cash with you; these people don't deal with plastic! ;-)</p>

                <h3>Museums & art</h3>
                <p>Mexico City is packed full of great museums. There are so many, that there is only space for a mention of the main ones to be made here. Be sure to acquire a good guidebook from the Mexperience Bookshelf for use as you discover Mexico City 'on the ground'!</p>

                <p>Also: For more information about art and artists in Mexico, connect to the section on <a href="">Mexican art</a>.</p>

                    <li><span lang="es">Galeria de Historia</span> (National History Museum) - Also known as the Museo del Caracol, this museum tells the story of Mexico's history and its struggle for independence and recognition as a republic. Located in Chapultepec.</li>
                    <li><span lang="es">Museo Nacional de Antropologia</span> (Anthropology Museum) - This is the world-famous & top-class museum featuring some of Mexico's most important historical and archaeological artefacts. The museum is one of the world's finest, and it will take you several days to see it all properly.

                    <li>Rufino Tamayo Museum - Rufino Tamayo is one of Mexico's most famous contemporary artists and this museum has a collection of his art and art from around the world - a collection donated to Mexico by Rufino and his wife.</li>
                    <li>Frida Kahlo Museum - The famous and eccentric lover, wife (later separated) and intellectual friend of Diego Rivera had a house in Calle Londres (London Street). Today, the house is a museum and contains samples of her work, as well as other Mexican arts and crafts. Located in Coyoacan.</li>
                    <li>Leon Trotsky Museum - Trotsky fled Stalin's Russia after being expelled from the Soviet Union and found refuge in Mexico, aided by his friendship with Diego Rivera and his wife Frida Kahlo. His small house on Calle Viena (No.45) is where Leon Trotsky met his fate. It has been preserved much as it was left when a Russian agent, acting on Stalin's orders to kill Trotsky, finally carried out his orders.</li>
                    <li>Franz Mayer Museum - This museum, is hosted in the serene surroundings of the 16th century Hospital de San Juan, on Avenida Hidalgo. Franz Meyer was a German philanthropist who moved to Mexico, obtained residence and citizenship and proceeded to build a colossal collection of Mexican arts and crafts including textiles, silver, pottery and furniture. The setting does justice to the works on display here - this is a truly serene corner in Mexico City's energy-filled metropolis. Located in the Colonial Centre.</li>
                    <li>Diego Rivera Mural Museum - Diego Rivera, one of Mexico's most famous, if not <em>the</em> most famous artist (muralist) to date, was best known for his stunning mural works. As you travel around the city, you may see some of his work; a lot of it is painted on civic buildings and also around the university area. Come to the museum to see examples of his murals, with full interpretations written in English and Spanish. Located in the Colonial Centre. </li>
                    <li><span lang="es">Museo Nacional De Arte</span> - National Art Museum. This museum hosts art from every type and style and technique of Mexican art throughout the 20th century. The building dates back to the early 1900's and has a magnificent marble staircase.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The Museums listed here are but a sample of the vast selection waiting for you to enjoy in Mexico City.</p>

                <h3>Cathedral and churches</h3>
                <p>Mexico's <span lang="es">Catedral Metropolitana</span> (Metropolitan Cathedral), off the <span lang="es">Zocalo</span> in the city centre is a magnificent work of Spanish colonial architecture, although other parts have been added since its original construction. Engineers have reinforced the Cathedral's foundations to stop it from sinking into Mexico City's soft foundations (the city was built on top of Lake <span lang="nah">Texcoco</span>, now drained), which means that scaffolding has had to be erected inside while this work continues, but the Cathedral is a must-see on a tour of Colonial Mexico City.</p>

                <p>One of the most revered religious places in all Mexico is the <span lang="es">Basilica de Nuestra Señora Guadalupe</span>. The church is modern and spacious, allowing thousands of worshippers to gather together at once; the legend behind the Image of the Virgin Guadalupe, hanging behind the main altar, is not. Back in 1531, an indigenous boy saw a vision of the Virgin, who told him to tell the local priest that he should build a church on the spot where he was. The priest did not believe the boy's vision, so he returned to the the spot, when he saw the Virgin for a second time. On this occasion, a gilt-edged imprint of her was miraculously placed on his coat. When he returned, the priest believed him. A microscopic sample of the material the printed image has been sent for tests, but the substance is not identifiable. The ink that makes up the image is also an enigma, and many miracles have surrounded the Virgin's presence. People from all over Mexico come to worship the Virgin, and many crawl on their knees on the way in to the Basilica itself.</p>

                <h3>National Monuments</h3>
                <p><span lang="es">Palacio Nacional</span> (National Palace) - This is where the President has his office (the former official residence is a place called <span lang="es">Los Pinos</span>, south of the city centre), also the nation's Treasury Office resides here. The land occupied by the Palace has a fascinating history, dating back to the Aztecs. Cortez destroyed the Aztec Palace and built his own, in the Spanish style with large courtyards. Later destroyed by revolutionary riots, it was built again and even now, takes up the entire eastern side of the <span lang="es">Zocalo</span>.</p>

                <p><span lang="es">Monumento de la Independencia</span> - Probably Mexico City's No.1 Landmark, situated on a roundabout in Mexico's downtown area, the Independence Monument sits atop a tall column, and is a statue of a gilded angel. Known as <span lang="es">"Ángel de la Independencia"</span> (the Angel of Independence), or just <span lang="es">"El Ángel"</span>. The sculptures that surround the base represent Law, Justice, War and Peace. The Statue was inaugurated in 1910. The huge earthquake in 1985 damaged the statue, but is has since been fully restored.</p>

                <p><span lang="es">Monumento a los Niños Héroes</span> - The Monument to the Young Heroes, in Chapultepec, is a bastion of Patriotism in Mexico. Six columns represent the six Cadets, who were based at the <span lang="es">Castillo de Chapultepec</span> (Castle of Chapultepec), then a military academy, who each wrapped themselves in a Mexican flag and jumped from the Castle to their deaths instead of surrendering to American troops, who had recently stormed the city.</p>
