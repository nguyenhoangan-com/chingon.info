                <h2>Preamble.</h2>

                <p>Mexico's Capital City, often referred to as just <span lang="es">CDMX</span> (Mexico City › <span lang="es">Ciudad de Mexico</span> › <span lang="es">CDMX</span>) or <span lang="es">"El D.F."</span> (the Federal District › <span lang="es">el Distrito Federal</span> › <span lang="es">D.F.</span>), is the most populous city in North America. In recent years, Mexico City has emerged as a top destination for expats, celebrated for its vibrancy, history and culture, while the city is giving way to its former reputation of crime and pollution.</p>

                <p>Mexico City <em>sprawls</em> - as you fly in, you cannot help but to be amazed by its sheer size. If you fly in at night, the lights you'll see glowing go on as far the eye can see: if you fly in by day, the never ending mosaic of buildings, roads and landmarks will extend far into the distance. Fortunately, a lot of the really attractive centres in Mexico are clustered together in easy-to-get-to areas. Three or four days here should be enough for you to experience all of the main attractions. For those willing to explore with an open mind, Mexico City has a feast of experiences waiting for you to enjoy and savour.</p>

                <p>To dismiss Mexico City for its size or previous reputation would be denying yourself a lifetime opportunity to sense, feel and experience one of the world's most contrasting; but also greatest, oldest and most inspiring cities.</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><p>For those with a refined palate, the choice of restaurants here is immense: whatever food you like or want to try - you can in Mexico City.</p></li>

                    <li><p>For the shoppers, Mexico City provides ultra-high doses of retail therapy, with a colossal variety of colors and flavors: Fruit and vegetable stalls, local one day a week markets, colonial markets and bazaars, specialist art and craft centres, chic boutiques, designer clothes and jewellery - it's all here, all you have to do is start looking.</p></li>

                    <li><p>For history, culture and archaeology fans, you will find a plethora of areas and places to feed their thirst for new insight and knowledge. World-class museums, arts and theatre, sculpture, murals and plazas, and a history which extends back over 12,000 years, to the first animals and inhabitants around Lake <span lang="nah">Texcoco</span> - the lake Mexico City was built on - and on which bed it still lies.</p></li>

                    <li><p>For those that like to chill, Mexico City also has several parks and natural areas, where people go to relax, converse, meet and just watch the world go by.</p></li>

                    <li><p>For general entertainment, Mexico City will fulfil just about any activity you have in mind that can logistically be catered for in an urban area. The night life is stunning and varied; during the day you can play sports, go to a funfair, ice-skate and a thousand other activities are all within a distance no further away than a couple of hours from your hotel's entrance.</p></li>
                </ul>

                <p>Not everyone who flies into the airport visits Mexico City. Some are there only to connect to an ongoing flight elsewhere, usually a colonial centre or coastal destination. However, Mexico City <em>by itself</em> is a great place to experience - there is a certain magic there that leaves a dust on its visitors' shoes which in most cases keeps them coming back for even more next time.</p>

                <h2>Section 1.</h2>
                <p>The attractions listed here are but a sample of the vast experiences waiting for you to savour in Mexico City. I recommend that, once your appetite is whetted from here, <em>get a Mexican friend and ask what's more!</em>.</p>

                <h3>Mexico City's Colonial Centre</h3>
                <p>The <span lang="es">Centro Histórico</span> (Historic Centre) focuses around the <span lang="es">Plaza de la Constitución</span> (Constitution Plaza) or more commonly known as the <span lang="es">Zocalo</span> (the Plaza), the second biggest in the world - only Moscow's Red Square betters it for size. This is the heart of Mexico City and its government, main business and financial centres all operate in and around this area. There are over 1,400 colonial buildings in this area: the feel is distinctly Spanish - they built their new city on top of the destroyed Aztec City of <span lang="nah">Tenōchtitlan</span>. Off the Plaza you can find the city's Cathedral and <span lang="es">Palacio National</span> (National Palace) - both are stunning examples of glorious colonial architecture. You can see some of the remains of the old city by visiting <span lang="es">Templo Mayor</span> - the archaeological site in the heart of Mexico City.</p>

                <h3><span lang="es">Zona Rosa</span></h3>
                <p>Translated, this literally means, "the pink zone", referring to the pink coloured tiles on the street, still there today. It was once the high-class residential area of Mexico City, before tourism, shops, restaurants, hotels and commercial office space took it over. Today, it is the centre of all commercial activity in Mexico, with up-market shops, hotels, restaurants and office space. There are some great hotels and restaurants to experience here, if you're not on an overly-tight budget. This area, along with San Angel (see below) is one of Mexico City's main night spots.</p>


                <h3>Coyoacán & San Ángel</h3>
                <p>These two colonial areas make up districts of today's Mexico City, but it hasn't always been this way. Not so many years ago, these areas were separate colonial towns in their own right! They both have a colonial atmosphere and charm all their own and are well worth a visit - especially at the weekend!</p>

                <p><i>Coyoacán</i>: The Central Plaza is a classic - with its street performers and ambulant vendors; a real family place on a Saturday afternoon. The streets in this area are all cobbled; the area is home to some of Mexico City's finest mansions and great museums. Many present-day celebrities live around here, as past celebrities have, including: Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera and Leon Trotsky.</p>

                <p><i>San Ángel</i>: Once a quaint town on the outskirts: now a suburb for the rich and famous, with cobblestone streets and leafy lanes. Some of the houses here are more modern, but there is also a great selection of colonial houses, mansions and haciendas. Some of these places have been turned into fine restaurants and fashionable night clubs. San Ángel is also one of Mexico City's prime night spots (see below).</p>

                <h3><span lang="nah">Chapultepec</span></h3>
                <p>Mexico City's large green area, <span lang="es">Bosque de Chapultepec</span> or just <span lang="nah">Chapultepec</span> (From the Aztec, meaning "Place of the Grasshopper") is the largest area west of the city, and incorporates: Chapultepec Park itself, the Castle where Maximilian ruled from before he met his fate in Queretaro, Mexico City's extensive Zoo, The world-famous Anthropology Museum, Chapultepec Fun Fair with its famous "Russian Mountain" wooden roller-coaster, several top-class Museums and Cultural Centres, and some of the City's finest Hotels and Restaurants. Just north of Chapultepec is the district of Polanco, an ultra-high class residential area, which is also host to Mexico's biggest and most elaborate US-Style Shopping Mall, Santa Fe.</p>

                <p>/add an image/</p>

                <h3>Floating gardens of <span lang="nah">Xochimilco</span></h3>
                <p><span lang="nah">Xochimilco</span> was considered outside of Mexico City as late as the 1970's. Today, it has been engulfed into the massive sprawl of the Capital, but the floating gardens - so called because of the the brightly decorated boats that float on a network of canals which is 50 miles long - and dates back to the time of the Aztecs.</p>

                <p>In years gone by, the boats would be decorated with real flowers, thus "floating gardens", but today only paint is used, save for special occasions, often requiring pre-booking and payment by the sponsor.</p>

                <p><span lang="nah">Xochimilco</span> itself is an old colonial town. Although run-down and in a seemingly state of decay, the area has a great colonial centre, and a couple of good markets. You'll pass these on route to the canal ports (of which there are several) - so take time to stop and experience them.</p>

                <p>For a very small fee, you can hire a boat to take you and up to 40 other people on a tour of the canal and environs. Boats come in three sizes; the small will seat up to around 10 people, the medium up to about 25 and the large up to about 40. Prices vary according to the size of boat (in Spanish <span lang="es">lancha</span>) you want, but prices are very reasonable.</p>

                <p>A bucket with beers and soft drinks will be placed on the boat; you pay for what you consume, plus a small tip for the vendor when you get back to port.</p>

                <p>While you're on your canal tour, you'll likely be approached by ambulant "floating merchants" selling anything from pottery and textiles to a full 5-course meal! Beware of the food, stick to the purified drinks bucket. Mexican mariachis may float up beside you on their boat, and in exchange for a small fee, will serenade your cruise or party with a feast of traditional Mexican music. Don't miss this opportunity!.. Remember to take some cash with you; these people don't deal with plastic! ;-)</p>

                <h3>Museums & art</h3>
                <p>Mexico City is packed full of great museums. There are so many, that there is only space for a mention of the main ones to be made here. Also: For more information about art and artists in Mexico, connect to the section on <a href="">Mexican art</a>.</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><span lang="es">Museo de Arte Moderno</span> (Modern Art Museum) - A selection of contemporary art by famous Mexican Artists. Located in Chapultepec.</li>
                    <li><span lang="es">Galeria de Historia</span> (National History Museum) - Also known as the Museo del Caracol, this museum tells the story of Mexico's history and its struggle for independence and recognition as a republic. Located in Chapultepec.</li>
                    <li><span lang="es">Museo Nacional de Antropologia</span> (Anthropology Museum) - This is the world-famous & top-class museum featuring some of Mexico's most important historical and archaeological artefacts. The museum is one of the world's finest, and it will take you several days to see it all properly. It's divided into sections, so choose your area of interest and go there to make best use of your time. Located in Chapultepec.</li>
                    <li>Rufino Tamayo Museum - Rufino Tamayo is one of Mexico's most famous contemporary artists and this museum has a collection of his art and art from around the world - a collection donated to Mexico by Rufino and his wife.</li>
                    <li>Frida Kahlo Museum - The famous and eccentric lover, wife (later separated) and intellectual friend of Diego Rivera had a house in <span lang="es">Calle Londres</span> (London Street). Today, the house is a museum and contains samples of her work, as well as other Mexican arts and crafts. Located in Coyoacan.</li>
                    <li>Leon Trotsky Museum - Trotsky fled Stalin's Russia after being expelled from the Soviet Union and found refuge in Mexico, aided by his friendship with Diego Rivera and his wife Frida Kahlo. His small house on <span lang="es">Calle Viena</span> (No.45) is where Leon Trotsky met his fate. It has been preserved much as it was left when a Russian agent, acting on Stalin's orders to kill Trotsky, finally carried out his orders.</li>
                    <li>Franz Mayer Museum - This museum, is hosted in the serene surroundings of the 16th century Hospital de San Juan, on Avenida Hidalgo. Franz Meyer was a German philanthropist who moved to Mexico, obtained residence and citizenship and proceeded to build a colossal collection of Mexican arts and crafts including textiles, silver, pottery and furniture. The setting does justice to the works on display here - this is a truly serene corner in Mexico City's energy-filled metropolis. Located in the Colonial Centre.</li>
                    <li>Diego Rivera Mural Museum - Diego Rivera, one of Mexico's most famous, if not <em>the</em> most famous artist (muralist) to date, was best known for his stunning mural works. As you travel around the city, you may see some of his work; a lot of it is painted on civic buildings and also around the university area. Come to the museum to see examples of his murals, with full interpretations written in English and Spanish. Located in the Colonial Centre. </li>
                    <li><span lang="es">Museo Nacional De Arte</span> - National Art Museum. This museum hosts art from every type and style and technique of Mexican art throughout the 20th century. The building dates back to the early 1900's and has a magnificent marble staircase.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The Museums listed here are but a sample of the vast selection waiting for you to enjoy in Mexico City.</p>

                <h3>Cathedral and churches</h3>
                <p>Mexico's <span lang="es">Catedral Metropolitana</span> (Metropolitan Cathedral), off the <span lang="es">Zocalo</span> in the city centre is a magnificent work of Spanish colonial architecture, although other parts have been added since its original construction. Engineers have reinforced the Cathedral's foundations to stop it from sinking into Mexico City's soft foundations (the city was built on top of Lake <span lang="nah">Texcoco</span>, now drained), which means that scaffolding has had to be erected inside while this work continues, but the Cathedral is a must-see on a tour of Colonial Mexico City.</p>

                <p>One of the most revered religious places in all Mexico is the <span lang="es">Basilica de Nuestra Señora Guadalupe</span>. The church is modern and spacious, allowing thousands of worshippers to gather together at once; the legend behind the Image of the Virgin Guadalupe, hanging behind the main altar, is not. Back in 1531, an indigenous boy saw a vision of the Virgin, who told him to tell the local priest that he should build a church on the spot where he was. The priest did not believe the boy's vision, so he returned to the the spot, when he saw the Virgin for a second time. On this occasion, a gilt-edged imprint of her was miraculously placed on his coat. When he returned, the priest believed him. A microscopic sample of the material the printed image has been sent for tests, but the substance is not identifiable. The ink that makes up the image is also an enigma, and many miracles have surrounded the Virgin's presence. People from all over Mexico come to worship the Virgin, and many crawl on their knees on the way in to the Basilica itself.</p>

                <h3>National monuments</h3>
                <p><span lang="es">Palacio Nacional</span> (National Palace) - This is where the President has his office (the former official residence is a place called <span lang="es">Los Pinos</span>, south of the city centre), also the nation's Treasury Office resides here. The land occupied by the Palace has a fascinating history, dating back to the Aztecs. Cortez destroyed the Aztec Palace and built his own, in the Spanish style with large courtyards. Later destroyed by revolutionary riots, it was built again and even now, takes up the entire eastern side of the <span lang="es">Zocalo</span>.</p>

                <p><span lang="es">Monumento de la Independencia</span> - Probably Mexico City's No.1 Landmark, situated on a roundabout in Mexico's downtown area, the Independence Monument sits atop a tall column, and is a statue of a gilded angel. Known as <span lang="es">"Ángel de la Independencia"</span> (the Angel of Independence), or just <span lang="es">"El Ángel"</span>. The sculptures that surround the base represent Law, Justice, War and Peace. The Statue was inaugurated in 1910. The huge earthquake in 1985 damaged the statue, but is has since been fully restored.</p>

                <p>/add an image/</p>

                <p><span lang="es">Monumento a los Niños Héroes</span> - The Monument to the Young Heroes, in Chapultepec, is a bastion of Patriotism in Mexico. Six columns represent the six Cadets, who were based at the <span lang="es">Castillo de Chapultepec</span> (Castle of Chapultepec), then a military academy, who each wrapped themselves in a Mexican flag and jumped from the Castle to their deaths instead of surrendering to American troops, who had recently stormed the city.</p>

                <h2>Section 2.</h2>
                <h3>Getting there...</h3>
                <p><b>by air</b> - Mexico City is the main airline hub in Mexico. You can fly to Mexico City from London, or via a connection from Continental Europe: Amsterdam, Paris, Madrid - USA: Chicago, New York, Miami, Dallas, Los Angeles and others.</p>
                <p><b>by bus</b> - You can travel to Mexico City on a luxury bus from main cities and towns across all of Mexico. Some buses travel overnight, allowing you to sleep and make the most of your available time.</p>
                <p><b>by car</b> - All roads in Mexico lead to Mexico City - it really is the airline and road hub of the nation. See additional information about <a href="">driving in Mexico</a> and <a href="">Mexico's toll roads</a>.</p>

                <p>/add an image/</p>

                <h3>Getting around...</h3>
                <p><b>from the airport</b> - The airport is quite close to Mexico City on the northeast side. Only take official taxis; you can buy tickets from the booths inside the airport terminal building.</p>

                <p><b>taxis</b> - Mexico City's Taxis are metered. Read the article about <a href="">travelling in a taxi in Mexico City</a>. Your hotel can arrange taxis for you; some have taxis waiting outside for you. If you speak Spanish, you will have a distinct advantage and be able to negotiate a better price! Another good reason to <a href="">learn Spanish</a>!</p>
                    
                <p><b>Mexico City Metro</b> - Mexico City's metro system is quite efficient, and inexpensive to travel on (MX$2 per ride [<a href="">currency converter</a>]), but it does get very crowded in the mornings and afternoons, during rush hour (6:30am - 9:30am / 4:30pm - 7:30pm). Avoid the Metro at these times if you can.</p>
                    
                <p>Watch out for pick-pockets, they work in groups and it's not just tourists they're after, but tourists do stick out on the Metro! It's best to avoid using the Metro after dusk, unless you know the area and you know where you're going.</p>
                                        
                <p>You'll find that metro carriages and stations are clean and tidy and that the service is generally efficient. Travel by metro can be faster than travelling by car or taxi if the traffic outside is heavy. During the rainy season (May-October) trains can run considerably slower after rain storms as many of the tracks are outside, and the system is the same as the one in Paris, France: rubber tires on flat metal tracks; when it gets wet, trains must slow down to avoid skidding.</p>
                    
                <p>The southern most point of the Metro network, at a place called "<span lang="es">Taxqueña</span>", is extended by a tram system which can take you into the heart of <span lang="nah">Xochimilco</span>.</p>
                    
                <p><b>Local buses / minibuses</b> - You'll see green and white minibuses everywhere in Mexico City. They connect the main Metro Lines with the 'rest of the city', and literally, keep people in the city moving. Without them, getting around Mexico City effectively would be almost impossible without a car. Their costs vary, depending on how far you intend to travel, but are very cheap all the same. As the Metro, they get extremely crowded at rush hour. You should read the article about <a href="">travelling on a bus/mini bus in Mexico City</a>.</p>
                    
                <p><b>Rent a car</b> - If you're planning to visit one Mexico's colonial cities or archaeological sites, you consider renting a car for the journey out (and back). Inside Mexico city, you're better off just using taxis and / or public transport. See additional information about <a href="">driving in Mexico</a> and <a href="">Mexico's toll roads</a>.</p>

                <h3>Some tips...</h3>
                <p>Mexico City's traffic is awesomely congested these days. Even with the introduction of "second level" sections of the city's main ring-road, traffic congestion has reached epidemic proportions. Allow extra time in your schedule to travel around the city -- especially during the busiest morning and evening rush hour periods.</p>

                <p>Traveling just a small few miles can swallow hours of time if you are unlucky; and "rush hour" is no longer restricted to certain times: it's virtually constant during the weekdays.</p>

                <p>Don't look at the map and think: "that's close": It isn't when you factor in Mexico City's near-gridlock traffic. This means that you should build-in additional travel time when you're touring Mexico City -- and getting to the airport!</p>

                <p>The exceptions are: Weekends: weekend mornings, traffic levels are much calmer; Easter:during this time the city 'empties out' and traffic congestion seems to vanish by comparison; Christmas week: the days between Christmas Day and the 30th December traffic levels are also subdued. NB: Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve on the city's roads are a usually nightmare, as people do last minute shopping and make final preparations for their festive celebrations.</p>

                <p>A tip for women travellers: dress down, and avoid the rush hours on the metro. Women and children are allocated special carriages at peak times on the busiest routes: check for the sign and head for the front of the train; when you cross the wide yellow line on the floor, you’re in the right place.</p>

                <h2>Section 3.</h2>
                <p>All <a href="">national events</a> are celebrated in Mexico City. However, some events are particularly big in the Capital, and these are listed below:</p>

                <p>Independence Day - Mexico's biggest party. The nation's President hails the cry "<span lang="es">Viva Mexico</span>" from the National Palace, (except every 6th year -the last of each Presidency-, when the President travels to Dolores Hidalgo, the town which bears the name of the man who made the original cry). During this National Celebration, the <span lang="es">Zocalo</span> fills with tens of thousands of people. If you go, don't take anything valuable, and wear old clothes - eggs and other party-pieces are thrown liberally at this party!</p>

                <p>December 12th is day of the Virgin Guadalupe, and the celebrations at the Basilica are huge. Thousands of people visit Mexico City to pay patronage to her on this day.</p>

                <p><span lang="es">Festival del Centro Historico</span> - Historic Centre Festival - dates vary, but the festival lasts 3 weeks and is an excellent outburst of culture, music, dancing, food and much more. Check with <a href="https://sic.cultura.gob.mx/ficha.php?table=festival&table_id=176/">the website</a> for dates.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Section 4.</h2>
                <p><b>Safety:</b> Mexico City is one of the safest places in Mexico. Do take note of taxi crime in Mexico City, and read the important advice about <a href="">travelling in a taxi in Mexico City</a>.</p>

                <p><b>Dress:</b> Mexico City, like Guadalajara, is a 'conservative dress' city. Don't bring beachwear, high-cut shorts, and sandals with you – you'll look like a round peg trying to jump into a square hole!</p>

                <p><b>Pollution in Mexico City:</b> Mexico City does suffer with a pollution problem, similar to that of Los Angeles in the USA, and care must be taken, especially by those with respiratory problems. You may get watery eyes, a runny nose, and a sore throat; or you may sense nothing, depending on the climate at the time of your visit. November through January tend to be the worst months for pollution. The colder air traps the contamination in the atmosphere, and it just hangs over the city. During the monsoon season (May–September), the afternoon rains really clean the air and leave it refreshed. Windy days have a similar effect. Mexico City is at altitude (7,400 feet above sea level, or put another way, about one and a half miles up in the sky!), so when you combine heat, altitude, and pollution, you may find yourself easily tired or feeling irritated. The remedy for this is to relax and rest, drink plenty of water, and slow your activity schedule down. Read the article about <a href="">dealing with altitude and other health matters</a>.</p>

                <h2>Section 5.</h2>
                <p>Mexico City is always alive, but at night, the vibrations pound and the parties kick into full swing. If you like wild nightlife, or are looking for something more cultured – Mexico City will have something for you to experience and remember!</p>

                <p><b>Locally hosted parties:</b> Check with your hotel and other local hotels about public parties they may be hosting during your stay. Traditional Mexican theme night parties are popular with the locals, and there's a chance you could join a really special night out – the real Mexican way – especially on the eve of September 16th, Mexico's Independence Day! Hosted parties usually include dinner, dancing, a show and/or live music (often authentic Mexican Mariachis), plus all drinks for a fixed fee. These events are always excellent value for money. Ask at your hotel to find out what is happening locally.</p>

                <p><b>Nightclub scene:</b> Mexico City has an enormous range and assortment of modern nightclubs to suit all tastes. Some nightclubs charge an all-inclusive cover fee; others a smaller cover charge with drinks on top. Drinks are served all night – don’t even consider going to a nightclub until about 11 p.m. or even midnight. Nightclubs keep going all morning, and people will start to leave around 6 or 7 a.m.</p>

                <p><b>Night bars / Restaurants:</b> There’s a good variety of late-night entertainment in Mexico City to keep you happy and entertained into the early hours.</p>

                <h2>Section 6.</h2>
                <p>All of the arts, crafts, foods, drink et al produced throughout Mexico are brought from every State in the country to Mexico City to be sold. The capital city's 'internal market' for Mexican goods is huge -- 22 million consumers -- so the domestic market alone is a vibrant one for the traders of these goods.</p>

                <p>If your time to travel to the regions is limited and you want to purchase some kind of regional specialty item from a place you can't get to (for example, black clay pottery from <a href="">Oaxaca</a>), Mexico City is an ideal place to procure it -- because you'll find it here.</p>

                <p>Conversely, if you plan to visit the regions, don't buy anything in Mexico City that you could buy (possibly -- directly from the makers) in the provinces!</p>

                <p>Ask locally at your hotel or even at bars and restaurants about the location of markets, craft centers and specialist suppliers of specific goods in the vicinity. Allow yourself a good half-day to go and find what you want: if you're really lucky it will be around the corner, but if not, Mexico City is big and getting around can take hours - literally. Getting to your market or craft center, finding what you want, and getting back will take more time than you realize. Don't look at the map and think: "that's close" -- it isn't when you factor in Mexico City's near-gridlock traffic.</p>

                <h2>Section 7.</h2>
                <p>Mexico City's climate is temperate all year-round. Summers are warmer, and temperatures can reach the 30's centigrade during the early afternoons, so if you're travelling in the summer months, bring light clothes. Note that it is not that common to see adults wearing shorts and in particular "beach" wear around Mexico City (except at leisure centres, sports clubs, etc). To blend in while walking the streets on hot days, wear light clothes that are not shorts or loud beach attire.</p>

                <p>In the winter, temperatures are spring-like during the daytime, but cooler in the mornings and at night. Bring a sweater and a coat.</p>
                    
                <p>The rainy season runs from May to the end of September. Rains tend to come in the afternoon, are fierce and leave the evenings dry and cooled off. If you're travelling during the rainy season, a light, rain-proof overcoat will come in useful.</p>
