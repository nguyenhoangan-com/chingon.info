                <h2>Preamble.</h2>

                <p>About 300 miles northwest of <a href="">Mexico City</a>, in the heart of Mexico's central region is the city of Aguascalientes – Capital of the state which bears its name. <span lang="es">Aguascalientes</span> means "hot waters" or "thermal springs" – one of the attractions of this thriving city. Besides the hot spring baths on the outskirts of town, and the fabulous colonial architecture still visible in the Colonial Centre of the city, Aguascalientes also offers visitors a selection of parks, museums, a famous art gallery, and modern shopping facilities.</p>
                
                <p>Textile is one of Aguascalientes' main industries – it has been for years and continues to be one of Mexico's major textile producing centres. As a result, many of the shops here sell an excellent assortment of locally made textile goods, ranging from placemats to curtains.</p>
                                
                <p>Although this city is not often billed as a tourist centre, Aguascalientes is well worth a visit when you're travelling in this part of the country. Experience Aguascalientes and you'll witness the emerging face of Mexico: where an old colonial town atmosphere meets a modern, but comfortable and easy-going city undergoing rapid and positive change.</p>

                <p>One of Mexico's largest festivals – <span lang="es">La Feria de San Marcos</span> (St Mark's Fair) is hosted here – see key attractions, below.</p>

                <h2>Section 1.</h2>
                <h3>Colonial Centre</h3>
                <p>The centre of the city has been excellently preserved and has a great colonial feel and atmosphere about it. The Cathedral in the middle of town is a classic piece of colonial architecture, more so because the second bell tower (the one on the right as you face the Cathedral from the front) is actually a complete modern restoration of the original bell tower!</p>

                <p>Don't miss the <span lang="es">Plaza de Toros</span> (Bull Ring) – even if you don't like bullfighting – the architecture is impressive and a good example of how modern colonial architecture can be blended in with the original works dating back hundreds of years.</p>
                
                <p>The <span lang="es">Palacio de Gobierno</span> (Government Palace) is where the local Governor's office resides and is also an impressive piece of architecture, inside and out. It is open to the public.</p>
                
                <p><span lang="es">Jardín de San Marcos</span> (St Mark's Garden) is a popular park with locals and visitors alike – the four arches at each corner of the park welcome visitors to experience its green and relaxing atmosphere.</p>
                
                <h3>Museums & Art</h3>
                
                <p>The most famous museum is the one dedicated to <span lang="es">José Guadalupe Posada</span>, a man who was born and lived in Aguascalientes and who is credited as the "founder of Modern Mexican art." The museum hosts a whole collection of his work as well as temporary exhibitions featuring other Mexican artists.</p>
                
                <p>Other museums, featuring art and the history in Aguascalientes, include: <span lang="es">Museo Regional de Historia</span> (History Museum), <span lang="es">Museo de Arte Contemporáneo</span> (Contemporary Art Museum), <span lang="es">Museo de Aguascalientes</span> (featuring art from Saturnino Herrán), and the <span lang="es">Templo de San Antonio</span> (Refugio Reyes' architecture).</p>
                
                <p>Look up Aguascalientes in the Internet for more information about these museums, or just ask somebody in the local tourist office.</p>
                
                <h3><span lang="es">Feria de San Marcos</span></h3>
                
                <p>Most people who come to visit Aguascalientes will come during the festival period of <span lang="es">Feria de San Marcos</span> (St. Mark's Fair), which runs from the last week in April through to May 10th. At this time of year, hotels are packed, parties go on forever, and the whole city buzzes with excitement. Local schools close for some of the period, and some local offices and factories also have holidays to celebrate.</p>
                
                <p>The fair attracts around a million visitors a year, making it the largest fair in Mexico. People come to see commercial and industrial exhibitions, bullfights, concerts, rodeos, and to gamble at the fair's temporary casino. Gambling is currently illegal throughout Mexico, but the <span lang="es">Feria de San Marcos</span> opens a specially licensed casino at the fair, where you can try your luck on the roulette wheel or test your Blackjack skills.</p>
                
                <p>Other cultural events, including art, theatre, and dance, are all prominent. There is also a funfair with mechanical rides; traditional food and drink is available everywhere, and parties go on throughout the night!</p>

                <h2>Section 2.</h2>
                <h3>Getting there...</h3>
                <p><strong>by air</strong> – You can fly to Aguascalientes from Dallas in the USA and other points in Mexico including <span lang="es">Ciudad de México</span> (Mexico City) and <span lang="es">Monterrey</span>.</p>
                <p><strong>by bus</strong> – You can travel to Aguascalientes on a luxury bus from Mexico City – the trip takes 6 hours. An overnight bus does run from Mexico City to Aguascalientes, leaving at around midnight and arriving in Aguascalientes at 6am, in time to enjoy the day there.</p>
                <p><strong>by car</strong> – Driving to Aguascalientes is very fast and efficient using the many high-speed roads that connect this region. See additional information about <a href="">driving in Mexico</a> and <a href="">Mexico's toll roads</a>.</p>


                <h3>Getting around...</h3>
                <p><strong>from the airport</strong> – The airport is not far from Aguascalientes on the south side of the city and ground transportation is available.</p>

                <p><strong>taxis</strong> – Taxis in Aguascalientes now have taxi meters; they are economical and very good value for money. Your hotel can arrange taxis for you; some post their rates on a board in the lobby. Keep in mind that taxis from hotels are often more expensive than street cabs. If you speak Spanish, you will have a distinct advantage and be able to negotiate a better price in these circumstances! Another good reason to <a href="">learn Spanish</a>!</p>

                <p><strong>rent a car</strong> – Aguascalientes is very accessible by road, and there is plenty to see and do in the surrounding areas – including no fewer than three other colonial cities! Renting a car would be a smart option if you're thinking about travelling around this region, as it will give you the freedom and flexibility to see more of the area and its surrounding attractions effectively.</p>

                <h2>Section 4.</h2>
                <p>Aguascalientes enjoys year-round, hot & dry weather. The climate is ideal for taking part in a variety of outdoor sports and activities and for taking in the local culture, architecture and scenery. Rain is seldom a feature here; when the rains do come they tend to be during the months of  May thru November, but as with most monsoon areas, rains tend to be fierce and brief in the late afternoon, leaving the evenings dry and cooled off.</p>
